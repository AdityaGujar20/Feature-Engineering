# Types of Feature Engineering:
1. Feature Transformation: Transforming the features 
   * Feature Scaling
   * Filling missing values
   * Handling Categorical Values
   * Outlier Detection
2. Feature Construction: Manually creating new features/columns
3. Feature Selection: Selecting relevent features
4. Feature Extraction: Programmatically creating new features
